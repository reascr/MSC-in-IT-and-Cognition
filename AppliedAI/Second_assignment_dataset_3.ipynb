    "The PlantVillage dataset contains 54,304 images. The images span 14 crop species: Apple, Blueberry, Cherry, Corn, Grape, Orange, Peach, Bell Pepper, Potato, Raspberry, Soybean, Squash, Strawberry, Tomato. In containes images of 17 fungal diseases, 4 bacterial diseases, 2 mold (oomycete) diseases, 2 viral disease, and 1 disease caused by a mite. 12 crop species also have images of healthy leaves that are not visibly affected by a disease.\n",

    "For this assignment, you will make a model that predicts whether a bell pepper leaf comes from a healthy or unhealthy plant (binary classification). The healthy bell pepper leaf images are in the `Pepper,_bell___healthy` folder, while unhealthy cherry leaf images are in `Pepper,_bell___Bacterial_spot`. You are allowed to use a pretrained model that you transfer to this problem, if you whish so. Keep in mind that the dataset is somewhat uneven between the classes. Make sure to apply a technique to mitigate for that."
